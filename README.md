An ideally refined web framework for Go.

High-performance? Fastest? Almost all web frameworks are using these words to
tell people that they are the best. Maybe they are, maybe not. Air does not
intend to follow the crowd. Our goal is always to strive to make it easy for
people to use Air to build their web applications. So, we can only guarantee you
one thing: **Air can serve properly**.

## FAQ

**Q: Why named Air?**

A: "A" for "An", "I" for "Ideally" and "R" for "Refined". So, Air.

**Q: Why based on the [net/http](https://godoc.org/net/http)?**

A: In fact, I've tried to implement a full-featured HTTP server (just like the
awesome [valyala/fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)). But when I
finished about half of the work, I suddenly realized: What about stability? What
about those awesome middleware outside? And, seriously, what am I doing?

**Q: Why not just use the [net/http](https://godoc.org/net/http)?**

A: Yeah, we can of course use the [net/http](https://godoc.org/net/http)
directly, after all, it can meet many requirements. But, ummm... it's really too
stable, isn't it? I mean, to ensure Go's backward compatibility (which is
extremely necessary), we can't easily add some handy features to the
[net/http](https://godoc.org/net/http). And, the
[`http.Request`](https://godoc.org/net/http#Request) does not only represents
the request received by the server, but also represents the request made by the
client. In some cases it can be confusing. So why not just use the
[net/http](https://godoc.org/net/http) as the underlying server, and then
implement a refined web framework that are only used for the server-side on top
of it?

**Q: Do you know we already got the
[gin-gonic/gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and the
[labstack/echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)?**

A: Of course, I knew it when I started Go. And, I love both of them! But, why
not try some new flavors? Are you sure you prefer them instead of Air? Don't
even give Air a try? Wow... well, maybe Air is not for you. After all, it's for
people who love to try new things. Relax and continue to maintain the status
quo, you will be fine.

**Q: What about the fantastic
[Gorilla web toolkit](https://github.com/gorilla)?**

A: Just call the
[`air.WrapHTTPHandler`](https://godoc.org/github.com/aofei/air#WrapHTTPHandler)
and the
[`air.WrapHTTPMiddleware`](https://godoc.org/github.com/aofei/air#WrapHTTPMiddleware).

**Q: Is Air good enough?**

A: Far from enough. But it's already working.

## Installation

Open your terminal and execute

```bash
$ go get github.com/aofei/air
```

done.

> The only requirement is the [Go](https://golang.org), at least v1.11.

## Hello, 世界

Create a file named `hello.go`

```go
package main

import "github.com/aofei/air"

func main() {
	air.Default.GET("/", func(req *air.Request, res *air.Response) error {
		return res.WriteString("Hello, 世界")
	})
	air.Default.Serve()
}
```

and run it

```bash
$ go run hello.go
```

then visit `http://localhost:8080`.

## Documentation

Does all web frameworks need to have a complicated (or a lovely but lengthy)
website to guide people how to use them? Well, Air has only one
[GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/aofei/air) with useful comments. In fact,
Air is so succinct that you don't need to understand how to use it through a
large document.

## Gases

As we all know that the air of earth is a mixture of gases. So the same is that
Air adopts the gas as its composition. Everyone can create new gas and use it
within Air simply.

A gas is a function chained in the HTTP request-response cycle with access to
the [`air.Request`](https://godoc.org/github.com/aofei/air#Request) and the
[`air.Response`](https://godoc.org/github.com/aofei/air#Response) which it uses
to perform a specific action, for example, logging every request or recovering
from panics.

```go
return func(next air.Handler) air.Handler {
	return func(req *air.Request, res *air.Response) error {
		// Do something here...
		return next(req, res) // Execute the next handler
	}
}
```

If you already have some good HTTP middleware, you can simply wrap them into
gases by calling the
[`air.WrapHTTPMiddleware`](https://godoc.org/github.com/aofei/air#WrapHTTPMiddleware).
