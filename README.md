# Air

This is a Go web framework that allows people to use it as natural as breathing. You can use it to develop a dynamic website or RESTful web service without too many pains.

High-performance? Fastest? Almost all of the framework are using these words to tell people that they are the best. Maybe they are, maybe not. This framework does not intend to follow the crowd. So, the Air web framework can assure you only one sentence: **it can run properly.**

## Installation
